My name is Tao Ruikang.

Of course, you can call my English name "Rico". Now, I'm working as a full-stack development engineer on the BeeArt project team at Thoughtworks.

In life, I am an open-minded, positive, and helpful person. I like 🎸, 🏋️, 📖 and 🎬.

At work, I am serious and responsible, and most importantly, I love teamwork very much.
