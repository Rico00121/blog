My name is Tao Ruikang, you can also call me Rico.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Cloud Network Infrastructure at two of the top science schools in Europe, where I aim to deepen my expertise in network infrastructure and push the boundaries of innovation in this field.

Previously, I had the opportunity to work at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/), where I served as a core engineer for the development of the incubator product [BeeArt](https://www.beeart.com/introduce) and as a consultant on the next-generation retail system for a leading German automotive company. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills, reinforced my passion for cutting-edge technology, and expanded my ability to work collaboratively in diverse, high-impact projects.

As I continue to grow in my career, I’m excited to contribute to projects that combine creativity and technology, and I’m always seeking opportunities to learn and collaborate with like-minded innovators.
